    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 large yellow onion, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, peeled and thickly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large rib celery, thickly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter </li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk </li>
        <li>Pinch nutmeg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole San Marzano or other good-quality tomatoes with thick juice</li>
        <li>12 ounces cooked pasta, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Chop the vegetables:</h3></li>
        <p>In a food processor, combine the onion, carrot, and celery. Pulse until finely chopped.</p>

        <li><h3>Cook the vegetables:</h3></li>
        <p>In a deep, wide skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onions, carrots, and celery.</p>
        <p>Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, or until soft and translucent but not browned.</p>
        
        <li><h3>Cook the beef:</h3></li>
        <p>Add the ground beef to the skillet with the saut√©ed vegetables. Add the salt and pepper. Break the meat up with a fork or a potato masher and cook over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, 
            mashing it until it is crumbly and no longer pink.</p>
        <p>You are not actually browning the meat, just cooking it until it no longer looks raw.</p>

        <li><h3>Simmer the meat and milk:</h3></li>
        <p>Add the milk to the skillet and simmer, stirring often, for about 4 minutes, or until the milk has almost completely evaporated. Stir in the nutmeg.</p>

        <li><h3>Add the wine:</h3></li>
        <p>Add the wine to the skillet and continue to simmer for about 5 minutes, or until it has almost evaporated.</p>

        <li><h3>Crush and add the tomatoes:</h3></li>
        <p>Pour the tomatoes into a bowl and squish them with your hands to break them up so there are no large pieces.</p>
        <p>Add them to the skillet and bring the sauce to a simmer. Turn the heat to low and simmer the sauce for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick.</p>
        <p>If the sauce begins to look dry, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons hot water. Taste and add more salt and pepper if you feel it's needed.</p>

        <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li>
        <p>Serve the sauce over a bed of cooked pasta.</p>

    </ol>
